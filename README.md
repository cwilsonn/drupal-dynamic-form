# Dynamic Form

## Description

This custom Drupal 9 module provides a demonstration of creating a custom form with a dynamically rendered conditional field.

Upon installation, a framework content type will be created, placeholder content for this type will be added to the Drupal site for demo purposes, and menu links will be added to the main navigation that route to the two demos I have included in this module. Once uninstalled, the framework content type, associated content, and menu links will be removed from the site.

## Objective

The objective of this custom module is to meet the following requirements:

- Display a custom form with the following fields:
  - a plain text field
  - a select list populated by node content
  - a text field that is conditionally rendered via AJAX based on the selected option from the select list

As a note, the select list option that will trigger conditional form rendering in this module is the 'other' option.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my custom module!
